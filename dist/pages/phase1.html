    <h2>Phase 1 <span>(2017-2021)</span>:</h2>
    <h1>Theoretical Framework</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>
      The first phase of project mCODE, named
      <strong>Data Reuse for Local Community (2017-2021)</strong>, was funded by
      the
      <strong>
        Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) (<a
          href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-96-17-0184-17"
          target="_blank"
          >#LG-96-17-0184-17</a
        >).
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Phase 1 focused on the exploration of the practices of community data
      reusers, with the aim to offer insights into developing and adapting
      public-library pilot services to meet community data reusers’ needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Phase 1 study followed a multi-phase research design. First, the
      project team conducted interviews and surveys with community data reusers
      to understand their data practices and reuse workflow. From the results,
      our team developed a theoretical model of community-inclusive data
      exchange/workflow. Second, the team conducted a study on librarians to
      investigate their roles in supporting their communities’ data needs,
      efforts, services, challenges, and opportunities and the knowledge and
      skills librarians need to effectively deploy data services. Finally, our
      team utilized the findings to improve or develop library services by
      collaborating with partner libraries to design prototype library
      services.

    <h2>Public libraries’ model for Community Open Data Engagement (mCODE)</h2>
    <p>
      The final model, mCODE, includes four focal service areas public libraries
      can use to support successful data reuse in their communities:
    </p>

    <ul class="areaServices">
      <li><span>Area 1.</span> Promoting open data access</li>
      <li>
        <span>Area 2.</span> Providing instructions to promote data literacy
        among the public
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Area 3.</span> Developing library programming from open data
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Area 4.</span> Developing internal data capacities for future
        service creation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For each focal service area, the model addresses six dimensions of
      organizational capacity (vision, human resources, financial resources,
      administration, infrastructure, and network) at three levels of engagement
      with data and data practices (beginning, maturing, and leading).
