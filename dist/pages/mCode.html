    We hope mCode will help librarians situate data services within their
    organizational context. Currently, most public libraries have limited
    data-related services that extend beyond the internal use of data to
    evaluate the use of resources and the impact of library programming. At the
    core of this model are values underpinning the work of public libraries, and
    the communities served are the bounds. Each layer of the model connects with
    and influences the next.

      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        Our professional core values of access, equity, intellectual freedom,
        supporting the public good, and sustainability connect with the ethics
        that have supported the development of the open data movement,
        particularly accountability and transparency in the public sphere. These
        both connect to the
        <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank"
          >UN Sustainable Development goals</a
        >, which are tied to change at the local level, where public libraries
        have the most impact on national agendas. Libraries must respond to
        societal changes, but the path to integrating that response into
        existing library services is not always clear. Take, for example, the
        integration of social services with library services to address the
        needs of library users in crisis; at this point, various models have
        emerged depending on the library's community, organizational structure,
        and culture.
      </p>

    <div class="interDataLevel">
      <h3>Internal Capacity</h3>
      <p>
        If your library's values align with using data for decision-making,
        meeting community needs, and strategic planning, you already have some
        internal capacity to work with data. Libraries use data to assess their
        community's return on investment in them for the services they provide.
        Many public library websites provide calculators to illustrate this
        return on investment publicly and internally; this data is used to
        evaluate and improve collections and programs to meet the needs of their
        communities. Further, libraries will use data about their communities to
        evaluate and improve the collections and programs offered. Depending on
        how broadly data is used within an organization, this will often limit
        the extent to which data use extends to the outer reaches of the model.
        If the capacity for working with data rests in the hands of only a few
        staff members, then the potential for doing more with data is limited.
        If there is one person primarily responsible for collecting and
        analyzing data within the library, then the reach of data services will
        be limited. Internal capacity is critical to expanding the impact of
        data services in public libraries.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dataAccessLevel">
      <h3>Data Access</h3>
      <p>
        How a library makes data accessible and to whom will depend on its
        internal capacity in terms of human resources and technology
        infrastructure. Some libraries make internal library data and community
        data widely accessible throughout the organization, encouraging library
        staff to utilize data in their work. For example, libraries create data
        dashboards utilizing homegrown tools or products like Power BI or
        Tableau. Additionally, making data accessible for analysis or use over
        the long term will require some level of professional expertise and
        technological support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data access can mean that public and collection service staff provide
        access to published data sources and can aid in using those sources. The
        kinds of data literacy and data analysis skills available to library
        users vary greatly depending on the library staff's expertise. There is
        no uniform expectation that public libraries or public librarians will
        provide access to data resources, tools, and assistance in using them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond service at an information desk, providing access to data to
        constituents external to the library can require community partnership,
        particularly if their data is being shared. For example, a partnership
        is a good idea if your library shares data collected by a local agency,
        such as crime data. You don't want to misrepresent the work of community
        agencies or appear to be critical or political in your sharing of their
        data. Typically, a more robust technical infrastructure will be needed
        to provide access to datasets and data analysis tools. MOUs, governance
        structures, data collection development policy are likely to be in place
        to guide this work. When public libraries provide access to local data,
        often a partnership is struck with the city government to support access
        to financial and technical resources, as well as buy-in from local
        agencies who might be hesitant to provide their own data to support open
        government through open access to data.

      <h3>Programming & Instruction</h3>
      <p>
        With access to any of the three kinds described above (internal,
        published data sources, or external), programming and instruction
        involving and around data are now possible. Audiences for the
        programming and instruction can be both internal and external. For
        example, internal access to library use data and data representing
        community characteristics can provide opportunities for in-service
        professional development aimed at either informing staff about decisions
        being made because of the data or teaching them to use it to meet the
        needs of the particular communities they serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming and instruction related to data can be provided to library
        users just as with any other areas for programming and instruction.
        Sometimes, the library takes the lead when it comes to such services.
        For example, librarians will often take the lead regarding instruction
        related to using subscription databases or summer reading programs.
        Whereas community partners are more likely to take the lead when it
        comes to English as a second language instruction and public safety
        programming. With data depending on the topic and the context, either
        library staff or community partners can take the lead. We have found
        that programming and instruction efforts related to data are most
        successful when collaboration between the library and community groups
        or agencies takes place.
      </p>

    <div class="communContextLevel">
      <h3>Community Context</h3>
      <p>
        For this reason, the community context is most closely connected to the
        programming and instruction aspect of the model, even though it envelops
        the whole of the library's role in this space. Programming is where
        relevancy is most keenly felt. For example, the local government aligned
        workforce development to data skills in one community. It supported the
        public library's early efforts to engage the community in using data to
        address local issues. Meanwhile, in another community, which is more
        affluent and highly educated in terms of its demographics, programming
        or instruction related to data could not gain traction.
